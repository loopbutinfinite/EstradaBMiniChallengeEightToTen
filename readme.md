### Mini Challenge Eight to Ten

### Description: Created an API that consists of small applications, such as Magic 8 Ball, Guess It, and Restaurant Picker. Each part of the application has endpoints that return back related responses from the user's input. Data validation is also implemented where necessary so that the user can only input number values only.

### Peer Review (Arianna Huntley) - runs well!
